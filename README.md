# OBS Autostarter

The OBS Autostarter is a lua script for OBS to automatically launch programms when OBS starts and to close them again then OBS is quit.

## Instalation

- Move script to script folder (always stay organized!)
- Add Script in OBS
- Select executable

## TODO

- Check if an instance is already running
- Integrate a way to choose more programms from a single script (Done, thx to carlosgrossi)
